# Age and Gender Distribution Analysis
## Introduction
This repository offers Python scripts to generate insightful bar charts or histograms, facilitating the visualization of categorical or continuous variables within population datasets.
This code provides visualization tools to analyze the distribution of ages and genders within a dataset. The code generates histograms for age distribution and bar charts for gender distribution.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib

4. Clone this repository to your local machine.
5. Run the Python script age_gender_distribution.py to generate visualizations of age and gender distributions.

## Sample Data
- Age Distribution: The age distribution is generated using numpy's random normal distribution with a mean age of 30 and a standard deviation of 10.
- Gender Distribution: The gender distribution is based on sample counts for different genders provided in the code.

## Files
- Task_1.ipynb: Python script for generating visualizations of age and gender distributions.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the repository and usage instructions.

## Visualization Outputs
- Age Distribution Histogram:
Displays the frequency distribution of ages within the dataset.
- Gender Distribution Bar Chart:
Illustrates the count of individuals belonging to different genders within the dataset.
